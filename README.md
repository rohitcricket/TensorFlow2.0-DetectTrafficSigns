# Detect Traffic Signs using TensorFlow 2.0

![trafficsign](trafficsign.jpg)

This project detects traffic signs for your self-driving car using LeNet network and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) 2.0. 

### Data Reference:

In this case study, you have been provided with images of traffic signs and the goal is to train a Deep Network to classify them
The dataset contains 43 different classes of images.

Classes are as listed below:
( 0, b'Speed limit (20km/h)') ( 1, b'Speed limit (30km/h)')
( 2, b'Speed limit (50km/h)') ( 3, b'Speed limit (60km/h)')
(4, b'Speed limit (70km/h)') ( 5, b'Speed limit (80km/h)')
( 6, b'End of speed limit (80km/h)') ( 7, b'Speed limit (100km/h)')
( 8, b'Speed limit (120km/h)') ( 9, b'No passing')
(10, b'No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons')
(11, b'Right-of-way at the next intersection') (12, b'Priority road')
(13, b'Yield') (14, b'Stop') (15, b'No vehicles')
(16, b'Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited') (17, b'No entry')
(18, b'General caution') (19, b'Dangerous curve to the left')
(20, b'Dangerous curve to the right') (21, b'Double curve')
(22, b'Bumpy road') (23, b'Slippery road')
(24, b'Road narrows on the right') (25, b'Road work')
(26, b'Traffic signals') (27, b'Pedestrians') (28, b'Children crossing')
(29, b'Bicycles crossing') (30, b'Beware of ice/snow')
(31, b'Wild animals crossing')
(32, b'End of all speed and passing limits') (33, b'Turn right ahead')
(34, b'Turn left ahead') (35, b'Ahead only') (36, b'Go straight or right')
(37, b'Go straight or left') (38, b'Keep right') (39, b'Keep left')
(40, b'Roundabout mandatory') (41, b'End of no passing')
(42, b'End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons')

The network used is called LeNet that was presented by Yann LeCun http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf

### Step 1: Import TensorFlow and Python Libraries


`See more steps in the colab.


### Step 2: Import the dataset

You will need to mount your drive using the following commands:
For more information regarding mounting, please check this out [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46986398/import-data-into-google-colaboratory).


```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

See more steps in the colab.



### Step 3: Visualize the dataset using Seaborn, a python library
See more steps in the colab.

### Step 4: Create testing and training data set and clean the data. 
See steps in the colab.

### Step 5: Train the Model. 
See steps in the colab.

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model. 
See steps in the colab.

### Step 7: Improve the Model
If you are not satisfied with the results, then you can increase the number of independent variables and retrain the same model. See steps in the colab.
